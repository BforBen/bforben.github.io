As many of you will know, I'm a big fan of Google products - I'm on my second Nexus phone and use G Suite (n√©e Google Apps) for my personal email, calendar and word processing etc. The real-time document collaboration is fantastic, so much so that we ended up using it for some things unofficially at work.

I've recently started work in the shared service for Royal Borough of Kingston, London Borough of Sutton and Achieving for Children who all share a single instance of Google's G Suite. I have to admit it was something that attracted me to the job. I'm now a month and a half in using it in a work environment every day and there have been definitely been some ups and downs using it in this context.

## The good

### I don't need to use Windows!

For the first couple of weeks I was using a large Windows laptop. It was massive, heavy, slow, very slow and just seemed really clunky to use when all I was doing on it was opening Google Chrome. And the battery didn't last very long so I had to carry power leads round all the time. It was also encrypted and was heavily locked down and took about 5 minutes to get to a usable state. I hated it.

Now I have my Chromebook (an [Acer Chromebook 14](http://us-store.acer.com/chromebook-14-cb3-431-c5fm) - all metal, with a full HD display) I have a super quick, light laptop that does everything I need. I can actually leave the power supply at home and work in some cases up to 2 days before needing to charge.

For the odd occassion I need to access the corporate network I can use the Citrix Receiver app for Chrome OS to log in to "Modern Desktop" (our name for the Citrix VDI Windows 8.1 desktop). At the moment the only time I've needed to use Modern Desktop is to access the HR self-service system.

### Hangouts

Working across multiple sites that aren't that geographically close (it's a good 40 minute drive between Kingston and Sutton offices) has been challenging at times. Hangouts however has for the most part been brilliant. Lots of meetings rooms are equipped with [Chromebox for Meeting](https://enterprise.google.com/chrome/devices/#asus-chromebox-for-meetings) and big TVs which makes having conversations with people really easy - especially when we can also all be looking at, and interacting with, the same Google Doc.

### Android for Work

Android for Work means I have access to all my work stuff on my phone via the native Android apps. It's all seperated from my personal data and work can only wipe work stuff, unlike the solution at my previous job where they were able to track the phone location and wipe the whole device.

Having a seperate space is not just about email and calendar but also my internet history and bookmarks in Chrome plus contacts.



### I don't need a desk or an office

With Google and the Chromebook I feel I really can work flexibly. I'm not constrained by needing to be connected to a private network or to a specific desktop computer.

## The not so good

Some of the staff still don't get Google and it's not the same as Microsoft products.

### Shared drives

I've come from a council with a multitude of network shares and SharePoint document libraries. 

The recently announced Team Drives might go some way to fixing this but I understand that it might be reserved for those that sign to G Suite Business (previously known as Google Apps Unlimited for Work) which is double the cost.



### Finding out who people are
