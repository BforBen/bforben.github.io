I figured I'd add my thoughts on low code platforms to the others that have been shared recently.

I don't think low code platforms are a problem per se, I think it's more for me about how they're pitched and sold. Councils are used to buying solutions whether that be a whole service via an outsourced provider or by purchasing some technology. In my experience these platforms are sold as a way round needing expensive developers and a way to bypass the ICT department which has been slow to respond to requests to support change or just says "no". These platforms are in theory so easy to use that anyone can rapidly build and maintain services with just a few days training on building forms. Many also have libraries of forms pre-built that can be lifted and re-used to make it even quicker.

It all sounds amazing, some might say a digital silver bullet - or not, [as Dave Briggs suggests](https://da.vebrig.gs/2018/05/09/there-are-no-digital-silver-bullets/).

I'm firmly in the "not" camp but I think they can form part of the arsenal. Whether you build, buy or low code there are many more aspects you need to consider...

## Technology is only part of it

The transformation councils are undertaking is not about buying technology. It's about redesigning services to better meet the needs of users in the most efficient way to make best use of the councilâ€™s limited funds.

Over the years departments will have already seen many transformation programmes come and go that will have resulted in upgrades to line of business systems, staff cuts and/or outsourcing. In my experience the staff are left are bruised, battered and tired of the constant pressure to deliver the same, or more, with less.

The pitch I've seen with low code is that councils see themselves as having empowered these same service staff to rebuild their processes on the platform in quick time and transform the way they work.

My fear is that low code platforms end up being rolled out the same way IT departments have provided office productivity software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The training is minimal, if it exists at all, and focuses on how to use some of the more common features but not how they should be applied. Without the right support, service staff do the best they can, but the result might not make the best use of the technology and the outcome is sub-optimal.

I see a risk with devolving low code "development" is the creation of a new legacy of forms and processes that are not understood or supportable other than by the creator in the same way teams often have a collection of under the radar Access databases or Excel spreadsheets that Geoff has created to paper over the cracks of missing functionality in a line of business system. There are also the lessons to be learnt from the legacy of devolved content management that many councils have been working to fix for the past few years as they remove or rewrite hundreds or thousands of web pages.

Part of redesigning services for me is about making sure the people involved in delivering that service are maximising their time on the aspects that only humans can do. Many of these staff are specialists in their field and we need to maximise those skills. It is not making best use of their time if they are creating and supporting the technical aspects of their service.

## Culture and service design

Part of redesigning services will require a change in the culture of councils to be more user-focussed and agile. Staff will need new skills and in some cases councils will need to recruit more.

The [Digital Service Standard](https://localgov.digital/service-standard) and [Government Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/set-up-a-service-team) make it clear that to successfully build and deliver a service requires a team with a range of skills.
