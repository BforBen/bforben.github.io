Last year a group of us got together online to look at [Wardley Mapping](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html) (also known as Value Chain Mapping). You can read more about what Wardley Mapping is and what we did in the session [in a previous blog post](/blog/2016/11/having-a-go-at-wardley-mapping).

Next Friday (28 April) I'm hosting another meetup with [Richard Barton](https://twitter.com/cioportfolio) at the [Kingston Council offices](https://www.kingston.gov.uk/location), but you will also be able to join via Google Hangout for those that can't make it in person. If you're interested, please add your details to [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmiWLUQishf_zfnoL2fj96M6qL1Tw0xSKBly42-Dh9Y/edit) or join the [LocalGov Digital Slack channel](https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/wardleymaps).
