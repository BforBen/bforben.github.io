[LocalGov Digital](http://localgovdigital.info): who knew you could achieve so much with so little?

For those of you that didn't realise, LocalGov Digital is just a bunch of people who give up their time because they are passionate about what they do and care about making great local public services. There is no company, no office, no staff and no money. Things like the website are funded from people's own pocket and events such as [LocalGovCamp](http://localgovdigital.info/localgovcamp) from sponsorship together with a lot of good will.

## My journey with LocalGov Digital

I discovered LocalGov Digital in late 2013 and since then I've watched the network grow, try things and develop. This year it has really taken off following the good work of [Phil Rumens](http://philrumens.blogspot.co.uk/) and others to make the [Local Government Digital Service Standard](https://localgovdigital.info/digital-service-standard) with help from [GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/01/guest-post-building-a-local-government-digital-standard/). There are now [peer groups forming across the country](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/localgov-digital-10479776496) to support adoption and use of the standard introducing even more people to the network.

Being part of LocalGov Digital has given me some fantastic opportunities to learn both from and with others, get support and also develop new skills. I've also tried to contribute back where I can by speaking at events such as the [Public Sector Show](http://www.psshow.co.uk), helping to [organise events](http://localgovdigital.info/news/localgov-digital-makers-meet-up/) or contributing my development skills to products like [Pipeline](http://pipeline.localgovdigital.info/).

The network also helped me to develop an idea I had with [Paul Mackay](http://www.folklabs.com/about-us/paul-mackay/) and [Dan Blundell](https://www.danblundell.com/) at LocalGovCamp 2014 to make a data standard for waste. The work we started as a hobby project went on to form the basis of the [DCLG Local Waste Service Standards project](http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/local-waste-service-standards-project/) which estimated that use of the standard could save Â£505 million for English local authorities over a 14 year period. It also learnt some pretty difficult lessons around getting councils to work together that has fed in to the [#VerifyLocal pilot projects](https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/03/verifylocal-pilots-are-open-for-business/).

I have however always found it difficult to explain to people what the network is and how they can get involved. The informal nature of the network means there isn't anything as such to sign up to or join. It's also been difficult where we've had ideas to be able to take them forward as individuals.

## Understanding the proposition

I think in the past few months LocalGov Digital has really started to understand what it's proposition is and has found new momentum. A number of us have attended meetings with more formal organisations over the past few years and nothing seems to happen. Following the closure of the DCLG Local Digital Programme that worked on projects such as the waste standards the [Local Digital Coalition](http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/) was formed to try and bring some of these organisations together but it feels like nothing has changed. It's simply not happening quick enough.

One of my favourite videos about digital and transformation is [Tom Loosemore talking at Code for America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE_zj-7A7A&t=1806s&list=PLDGsBgVz2W87cAfk2y2SSods5kvlykpLi&index=1) and the need for new institutions. I'm not going to suggest LocalGov Digital could solve all the woes but I do think that by becoming a more formal _thing_ we will be able to do more and give even more credibility to what we do.

Becoming a _real thing_ means LocalGov Digital has more certainty and also a way to do things like bid for funding without relying on someone within the network being able to receive organisational backing. There have been aspirations in the past to be in a position to fund some people to more fully focus on our values, bringing councils and other local bodies together to make public services better.

Today LocalGov Digital is proposing the _thing_ we become is a co-operative, owned by individuals who are willing to commit to support the values and principles of the co-op such as support on a personal level for the Local Government Digital Service Standard. One suggestion is for the required annual meeting be LocalGovCamp and the regional peer groups could serve as local member meetings.

### Why a co-operative?

LocalGov Digital has been about the people involved and we think the co-operative model allows us to make LocalGov Digital in to a proper entity but keeping the people, or members, at the heart. I think it will also bring about an even bigger opportunity for people to get involved and have their say.

### Why charge for membership?

No specific amount for joining the co-op has been proposed but I think there is something symbolic about paying to join which I hope will mean people will really support the values. I've already mentioned that nearly everything LocalGov Digital has done to date has been through goodwill or sponsorship which means it's not always been easy. Having some income from members, even if it is small, will be really beneficial. It's not about profit but bringing a bit more certainty and sustainability to the network as well as the ability to do more. Especially in the current climate it is getting increasingly harder to get enough sponsorship to run events and as we look to do more that is not going to get any easier. We'd also like to try new things - for example, some of us met at the end of last year and talked about developing and providing learning opportunities but with out seed money it's hard to achieve.

I'd also like to explore what [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/about-us) have done (who have similarities to LocalGov Digital in terms of their aims and values) with initiatives like [fellowships](https://www.codeforamerica.org/do-something/work-with-us). Their model is based around being a charity, accepting donations and charging an entrance fee for their annual summit.

## What do you think?

For me, formalising LocalGov Digital has been a long time coming and I think it's a really exciting prospect. It is however just an idea at this stage, so please share your thoughts by blogging yourself, tweeting [@LocalGovDigital](https://twitter.com/LocalGovDigital) or emailing <feedback@localgovdigital.info>.
