[LocalGov Digital](http://localgovdigital.info): who knew you could achieve so much with so little?

For those of you that didn't realise, LocalGov Digital is just a bunch of people who give up their time because they are passionate about what they do and care about making great local public services. There is no company, no office, no staff and no money. Things like the website are funded from people's own pocket and events such as LocalGovCamp from sponsorship together with a lot of good will.

## My journey with LocalGov Digital

I discovered LocalGov Digital in late 2013 and since then I've watched the network grow, try things and develop. This year it has really taken off following the good work of [Phil Rumens](http://philrumens.blogspot.co.uk/) and others to make the [Local Government Digital Service Standard](https://localgovdigital.info/digital-service-standard) with help from [GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/01/guest-post-building-a-local-government-digital-standard/). There are now [peer groups forming across the country](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/localgov-digital-10479776496) to support adoption and use of the standard introducing even more people to the network.

Being part of LocalGov Digital has given me some fantastic opportunities to learn both from and with others, get support and also develop new skills. I've also tried to contribute back where I can by speaking at events such as the [Public Sector Show](http://www.psshow.co.uk), helping to [organise events](http://localgovdigital.info/news/localgov-digital-makers-meet-up/) or contributing my development skills to products like [Pipeline](http://pipeline.localgovdigital.info/).

The network also helped me to develop an idea I had with [Paul Mackay](http://www.folklabs.com/about-us/paul-mackay/) and [Dan Blundell](https://www.danblundell.com/) at LocalGovCamp 2014 to make a data standard for waste. The work we started as a hobby project went on to form the basis of the [DCLG Local Waste Service Standards project](http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/local-waste-service-standards-project/) which estimated that use of the standard could save Â£505 million for English local authorities over a 14 year period. It also learnt some pretty difficult lessons around getting councils to work together that has fed in to the [#VerifyLocal pilot projects](https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/03/verifylocal-pilots-are-open-for-business/).

I have however always found it difficult to explain to people what the network is and how they can get involved. The informal nature of the network means there isn't anything as such to sign up to or join. It's also been difficult where we've had ideas to be able to take them forward as individuals.

## Understanding the proposition

I think in the past few months LocalGov Digital has really started to understand what it's proposition is and has found new momentum. A number of us have attended meetings with more formal organisations over the past few years and nothing seems to happen. Following the closure of the DCLG Local Digital Programme that worked on projects such as the waste standards the Local Digital Coalition was formed to try and bring some of these organisations together but it feels like nothing has changed. It's simply not happening quick enough.

One of my favourite videos about digital and transformation is [Tom Loosemore talking at Code for America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE_zj-7A7A&t=1806s&list=PLDGsBgVz2W87cAfk2y2SSods5kvlykpLi&index=1) and the need for new institutions. I'm not going to suggest LocalGov Digital could solve all the woes but I do think that by becoming a more formal _thing_ we will be able to do more and give even more credibility to what we do.

So today we're announcing a proposal to become a co-operative, owned by individuals who are willing to commit to support the values of the Local Government Digital Service Standard. Our annual meeting would be LocalGovCamp and the regional peer groups could serve as local member meetings.

For me it's been a long time coming and I think it's a really exciting prospect - what do you think?
